# Initiative

Organise TTRPG groups and find time slots for games.

## TODO
- User management
  I probably want to look into Oauth with google? Seems like I just need to know user emails/names and probably that is enough.
  Then I need to tie "who is doing each action" together with the actions so I can have DMs creating games and players signing up. Need to have the concept of who is playing each session and what each players availability is.
  
- Session Booking.
  I think I have landed on availability being the name for when you can play which is transformed into a session when it's booked in. Need to store availability for each game tied to each player. Probably lots of join tables!
  
- CI
  Run tests in github, spin up docker container
